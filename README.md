# TODO List

> **Prerequisities**
- [] Read the [Uluhansın et al. (2019)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SvxjoTgBtMhEw7FkK61PPhNAt3kecfEz/view?usp=sharing) and [Aloush et al. (2020)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xy0_IOHqHzSTdkWK07TeWwX-RwiO4Jf7&authuser=banu.kabakulak%40gmail.com&usp=drive_fs) final project reports.
- [] Multi-drone flight via Router. The WiFi connection of the computer can be preserved via a WiFi USB dongle.

Here is Bashar's tutorial for router connection via [PacketSender](https://youtu.be/T4ISyGfzwqI).
  
  [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_tI6B2bicM)
lists all the IP addresses in your network with command ``arp -a``
- [] Read the literature in the previous year reports. 

> **Tutorials**
- [] Drone Flight Dynamics can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0KBu2ihp-s).
- [] Drone Programming with Python can be seen in the [Murtaza's Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmEcyQnfpDA) channel. 

> **In This Project**
- [] Get the state of a Tello drone via Python. Here is the [Tello GitHub](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/blob/master/djitellopy/tello.py) page.
- [] The control commands should be given as the velocities  ``(v_x, v_y, v_z)`` in 3D, together with the heading angle ``alpha``. 
- [] Prepare a presentation on the flight dynamics of a drone. 
- [] Install AirSim on computer. Here is our meeting record for [AirSim](https://youtu.be/0_iNuuqMBHI) installation. 
- [] Design a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python and publish the results in a ``.html`` file. 

> **Literature Review**
- [] Investigate Particle Swarm Optimization method. 

> **General**
- [] Register to a İHA1 training camp.
